bit manipulation readme
a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
Return: the converted number, or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
b is NULL

 a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured



 a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred


a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred


a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);


a function that checks the endianness.

Prototype: int get_endianness(void);
Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian
